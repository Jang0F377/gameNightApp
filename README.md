# Game Night App
  React Native application I built because our family has a lot of game nights and we are always missing a timer 
  and/or scoreboard so we usually make some makeshift scorecard and someone will use the clock or a timer on their phone.
  I wanted to solve that and keep it in one central location. Your met with the first screen which asks you to choose 
    * how many players
    * how much time on the clock 
  You then press the "Begin Game" button and it will take you to the game screen where you will have the clock,
  with functionality to pause/play and reset. Below that the scoreboard and below that, finally, we have the component
  to add or subtract to the score of each team. At the bottom there is an "End Game" button that will reset state and take
  you back to the first screen.

# Technologies used:
 * React-Native
 * Redux Toolkit
 * React-navigation
 * Tailwind React Native Classnames (twrnc)
 * React-Naive Countdown Circle Timer for the timer (obviously)
  
 
# What did I learn
  This was a fun project where I could make something I knew would be useful during our game nights.
  I learned to use Redux toolkit to manage state as well as (in my opinion) the best tailwind option for 
  React-Native, it was fun to learn and implement, I love tailwind for React and this delivered for me.
  
# Hurdles Overcome
  * Understanding how to represent and manage state for the timer as well as the number of teams and their individual scores.
  * Learning how flex works in React-Native and using it to position or justify components.
  * Implementing the coundown circle timer.
